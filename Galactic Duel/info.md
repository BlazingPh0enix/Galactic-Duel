There are 4 python files:

1. GalacticDuel
2. gameWindow
3. shipFunctions
4. variables

- variables contains all the variables required in the entire game and the making of the spaceships. Makes it less clustered and easier to access them.
- gameWindow contains the code related to making the Window for the game and the elements for the game.
- shipFunctions contains the movement functions of the ships and the working of the bullets.
- GalacticDuel contains the main file. The loop keeps on running until the user closes the window.
